# Qowala Browser Plugin

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Qowala/browser-extension.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Qowala/browser-extension)

Do you know how much time you spend on social networks? This plugin will help you to know.
Simply add the Qowala plugin to your browser and it will display the time you spent.

Available for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-us/firefox/addon/qowala/)

Compatible with Chrome but currently not available on the Chrome Store. So you need to install it manually.

This plugin browser is part of the Qowala project which aims to help you have a better 2.0 life.
We think you should be able to master your tools and not be mastered by them. So, use social networks wisely and do not forget to get some fresh air!

Open the extension's popup to see how much time you have spent on the current website. And switch between websites in the dropdown to compare.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="screenshot-popup.png" alt="Popup"></div>

If the default websites we added don't suits you, feel free to edit the websites to be tracked either with the module's popup or in the module's Preferences.

### Implementing features and solving bugs

We advice you to use `web-ext` if you want to write some code. Install it with `npm install -g web-ext`.
Then, to test the extension with auto-reloading, run `web-ext run`.
